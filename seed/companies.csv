Imagine never having to play a game of email ping-pong again or decipher a redlined MSWord circulated internally and/or externally to determine the sequence in which changes had been made! Or, no long having to constantly check you are working on the correct version of a document when working with multiple parties. ContractRoom does away with all this annoyance!; Transaction and Behavior Data - it captures and leverages transaction and behavior data from the entire back-and-forth negotiation, not just final outcome. ContractRoom keeps a data record of every negotiation offer and counter on any business term or legal clause as well as tracking how long it takes (“timers”) and how many changes are made (“counters”). Once these data sets are aggregated, the system can make inferences for future deal-making and decision-making in real-time, what we call Predictive AgreementTM.

All with one purpose – to create a revolutionary new tool – Estate Guru. While Estate Guru is new, the knowledge and analytics behind it are not. Our team’s intimate knowledge and extensive experience covers every area of the estate planning process. Our collective expertise has been worked into the tool to create and manage estate plans that fit every unique need without breaking the bank. The platform has been designed to create documents in real time for simple accounts while aggressively looking for circumstances that need a traditional approach. Once the attorney has signed off on the legal logic in the tool and has approved the document templates as appropriate for the state(s) they practice, the platform allows the attorney to seamlessly scale their estate planning practice. Attorneys are now able to extend their practice into the offices of financial advisors or the homes of clients. In addition to generating revenue for all the automated work, attorneys get to personally service all the accounts that are too complicated for automation. These complicated accounts can then be billed at the attorneys normal rate. So Estate Guru becomes a way to find profitable accounts. The platform continually reaches out to clients to keep the client and the attorney informed of any life events that may require an update to their estate plan. In this sense, Estate Guru acts as an estate planning CRM. Finally, when clients die, the attorney is notified so they can help with the estate settlement work.

Quietly it has been building market share in the legal research market for lawyers, with more than 800,000 subscribers. Fastcase's legal research service is poised to make some major changes in the way that lawyers access the law. It sorts results algorithmically, like Google, bringing the best results to the top. But more than that, it incorporates citation analysis right into the results, so you can see which cases are most cited. The service also allows customized results -- users can sort results a dozen ways to emphasize what's important to them. The service is also the first to move legal research beyond the tired ""search-results-document"" paradigm, with cool data visualization tools that create beautiful, four-dimensional maps of search results. The most important cases jump off the pages in these maps -- just one of many interesting tools that make Fastcase a smarter alternative for legal research. This is a paradigm shift. In the past, the emphasis in legal research was on taxonomic or editorial tools that helped lawyers or legal researchers find the most important cases, kind of like Yahoo's categories helped people find pages on the early Web. Fastcase allows users to organize the law with search tools and intelligent algorithms, much like Google did in the Web. And like Google, once people use Fastcase's search tools, they find it difficult to go back to the old, pre-chewed editorial indexes of traditional legal research. In February of 2010, Fastcase introduced the first legal research application for the iPhone (www.fastcase.com/iPhone) -- which is free to download and free to use (free registration required). Apple has ranked the app as one of its featured ""What's Hot"" applications, and it has been one of the most downloaded free reference apps in iTunes. Fastcase released the first iPad app for legal research in July 2010 (www.fastcase.com/iPad). In 2011, it released the first legal research app for iPad, and in 2012, it released the first legal research app for Android. Most recently, Fastcase has launched its AI Sandbox, which offers corporate legal departments, law firms, and law schools a private environment in which they can mash up their data with public legal data sets using IBM Watson Developer Cloud APIs, or tools from Neota Logic, Lex Predict, or Contract Standards.

Unlawfully lose your apartment, your job, or custody of your kids? If you’re a low-income individual in the US, chances are you’d be out of luck: market rate for an attorney is over $250/hour, and there is no Constitutional right to an attorney outside of criminal law.
  
Esqalate is an Orange County-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit startup that operates a pioneering web platform aimed at bridging the Access to Justice Gap – Proboknow.com.
 
Proboknow connects low-income clients with attorneys looking to gain practical experience; the attorneys work pro bono, and are guided through their cases by more experienced attorney mentors. The idea is to allow newer attorneys and attorneys looking to transition practice areas to gain the practical experience they need while helping those in need. New attorneys are struggling to break into the profession; close to half of them can't find full-time legal employment even 10 months after graduation from law school. So their need, just like the need of the low-income clients on our platform, is also strong. But, Proboknow is also for those attorneys who have no interest in gaining practical experience and just want to give back through pro bono - for each and every attorney interested in pro bono, we provide a much more convenient and efficient way to find and connect with pro bono clients, as well as to find the help and resources needed during pro bono representation.
 
So far, with very limited resources (all three cofounders – two attorneys and a tech cofounder - have been working full-time on an unpaid basis), Proboknow has been able to provide roughly $85,000 worth of legal services to over 40 clients. Numbers aside, this legal representation has been hugely life-impacting - on issues ranging from child custody to wrongful eviction. Proboknow launched in beta version in 2016; the optimized version of the Proboknow platform will be launching within in a month.
 
Esqalate is currently a startup team at UC Irvine’s Wayfinder incubator. It recently beat out 41 other startup teams to win the UC Irvine Blum Center for Poverty Alleviation’s “Designing Solutions for Poverty” startup competition, and also won UC Irvine’s “Most Potential for Societal Impact” startup award.",www.proboknow.com,@proboknow,"","",", legal services, access to justice",false,

Early 2016 we were the first in Europe to add proof of existence (using the Bitcoin blockchain) in our application for the documents being signed / agreed. By doing so we introduced the blockchain to organizations, showing it was useful for more than digital currency.

In 2017 we introduced LiveContracts; A platform to model agreements in such a way that they are easily understandable for both computers and humans. 
Breaking down an agreement or law in these understandable pieces has the added benefit that some parts (those considered simple and safe enough) can be executed by computers that have no or very basic AI. Other parts can be left to human interpretation.

Using this technology, the system can come up with similar clauses during writing, highlight duplicates and potential contradictions. 
Another use case is to automatically process, understand, route, and compare incoming documents with internal standards.

Additionally, the semantic processing of contract text through AI can help by detecting inapplicable, missing information, and unclear formulation  as depicted below.
The system suggests potential flaws in clauses and makes optimization suggestions to the editor of the contract.

The system is provided as micro services and can therefore integrate into any given (computerized) process within a law firm.

Erin Curtis Dierks,ecd@firesignmarketing.com,EDZ Systems ,"Overland Park, Kansas",2015,false,Document Automation,,,"EDZ Systems Launches Intelligent RMSTM

First Tool of Its Kind to Integrate Law Firm Data In One Intelligent System

OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (August 28, 2018) – EDZ Systems today announced the launch of Intelligent RMS, a software solution designed to make law firms and corporate legal departments more informed, adaptable and strategic by bringing together all of their data on one intelligent platform.

Most law firms don’t lack data. They have a significant volume of business intelligence from multiple software sources – matter management, timekeeping, finance, human resources, marketing and more – as well as offline documents. However, as this information sits in disconnected systems and spreadsheets, law firm leaders don’t get a complete view of the business.

That’s where Intelligent RMS can help, said Elizabeth DeZeeuw, the president and CEO of EDZ Systems.

“Unlike any other product on the market today, Intelligent RMS helps legal teams see the big picture so they can make better decisions faster. This can lead to smarter business development, resource utilization and client management, as well as revenue growth and cost elimination,” she said. “It provides law firms the actionable optics to deliver better service for their clients and stronger profit for their partners.”

How it Works

Data visibility has been a critically lacking component of law firm management, DeZeeuw said. According to a study by FRONTEO, just 40 percent of law firms have dashboarding capabilities, compared to nearly three-fourths of corporations.

Indeed, data is often spread across law firms in separate systems that don’t integrate. Intelligent RMS brings together data from existing siloed applications into a single real-time display.

It’s common for law firms to use one provider for timekeeping and billing, and another for financial analysis, and still another for client contact information, DeZeeuw said. Intelligent RMS works across vendors, platforms and technologies; it can incorporate data onto a law firm dashboard regardless of source.

Corporate legal departments also can utilize Intelligent RMS to streamline their data and resources, DeZeeuw said.

Doug Doerfler, a former AmLaw 200 chief financial officer and Intelligent RMS user, said the software delivers ROI for law firms by improving efficiency, eliminating manual processes and focusing resources on the activities that matter most.

“In more than 20 years, I have not seen such a valuable solution,” Doerfler said. “This platform fills an important gap for firms, providing leaders real-time visibility across their business – and access to information in seconds. This increases efficiency in key areas: resource, matter, project, practice and lateral management.”

As a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product, Intelligent RMS is available for a per-user monthly fee plus an implementation charge based on firm size. There are no hardware or server requirements.

Following integration – which is estimated to take days, not months– users have access to centralized data and can create custom displays or dashboards.

More information is available at www.edzsystems.com.

About the Company

Based in Overland Park, Kan., EDZ Systems was founded by technology professionals that were former executives at DST Systems, an international leader in financial and healthcare software solutions. Their corporate experience inspired Intelligent RMS.

A certified minority- and woman-owned firm, EDZ Systems offers law firm users a foundation of industry best practices and technologies. Prior to launch, the company tested and validated Intelligent RMS in AmLaw 200 firms.

There are over 3,000,000 patent applications filed each year around the world, and that number is growing. But many of these applications are rejected, often because the proposed invention is too similar to existing technology.

Mr. Scott Allan,s@sallan.com,The Corporation For Form Reform,Toronto,2017,false,Document Automation,,,"Our tool enables self-represented litigants, lawyers and legal professionals by removing the complexity associated with determining which court mandated forms are required in any particular situation, and facilitating the completion of these forms. Incorrectly completed court forms are a common challenge for lawyers, legal professionals, and especially for self-represented litigants. We remedy this by providing our users with a simple, easy to use tool.

Our first online tool asks users to respond to simple questions that determine which family law forms will need to be filed with the courts to initiate or respond to family law matters. The questions take a range of scenarios into account, including divorce, child custody and property claims. Based on the user’s response, the tool asks only for the appropriate information the user will need to provide in order to complete the form properly. If a user needs to file multiple forms, the tool autofills answers to questions repeated on subsequent forms. Once the forms are completed, they're available to download or fax. 

The tool is accompanied by a free guide called Common Sense Guide To Divorce in Ontario. The guide aims to help people better understand and cope with the stress of divorce and separation, giving some support to what is typically an arduous process.

Currently, the service is available to users in Ontario, Canada. In 2019 we will be offering the service in US jurisdictions, as well as expanding to other areas of law.
